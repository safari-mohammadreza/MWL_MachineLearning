# Mental Workload Calculation from EEG Signals

This repository contains code related to our research on calculating Mental Workload (MWL) from EEG signals using the STEW dataset. Our approach leverages brain effective connectivity, machine learning techniques, and feature selection algorithms.

## Overview

Mental Workload (MWL) is a critical factor in understanding cognitive performance and human-computer interaction. By analyzing EEG signals, we aim to develop models that accurately assess MWL levels.

## Key Components

- **Dataset**: STEW dataset containing EEG recordings.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Brain Effective Connectivity
  - Machine Learning Algorithms
  - Feature Selection Methods

## Sample Connectivity Visualization
